Prompt given to Google Gemini: JSON Lexical Extraction (Hermeneutic Vectoring)

You will be given a literary text.
Your task is not to interpret, analyse, summarise, or evaluate the text.
Instead, identify words and short phrases that explicitly appear in the text and are associated with psychological distress, perceptual instability, repression, confinement, or trauma-related discourse, understood in a historical and non-clinical sense.
Constraints:
Do not infer emotions, themes, or diagnoses.


Do not explain or categorise the words.


Do not modernise or normalise historical vocabulary.


Include only words or phrases that occur in the text itself.


Remove exact duplicates.


Output format:
 Return only a valid JSON object in the following structure:
psychological_words_json = """
 {
  "psychological_words": [ . . .
  ]
}
"""
