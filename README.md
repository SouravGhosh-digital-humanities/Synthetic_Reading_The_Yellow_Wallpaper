# Hermeneutically Vectored JSON for Literary Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a JSON entry developed as part of a post-positivist Digital Humanities methodology. The dataset is not intended as neutral data but as theoretically situated capta, produced through interpretive judgment prior to computational or AI-assisted processing.

## Methodological Framework
The methodology rejects positivist assumptions that meaning emerges from computation alone. Instead, interpretation functions as the epistemic precondition of analysis (Fish). Computational and AI tools are deployed heuristically, following interpretive vectoring rather than generating meaning independently (Ramsay; Drucker).

## Structure of the JSON
The JSON file includes:
- Explicit interpretive categories
- Theory-informed labels
- Metadata describing methodological assumptions
- Versioning information for transparency

## Scholarly Use
This repository is intended for:
- Literary and Culture studies research
- Critical Digital Humanities
- Methodological experimentation
- Teaching interpretive computation

Users are encouraged to cite this work and to acknowledge its theoretical assumptions when reusing or adapting the data.
